## Building Grain

To build the compiler, you'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/) v14, [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install), [CMake](https://cgold.readthedocs.io/en/latest/first-step/installation.html) and [M4](https://www.gnu.org/software/m4/).

Start by cloning the Grain repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:grain-lang/grain.git
cd grain
```

To get everything set up, run:

```bash
yarn
yarn setup
yarn compiler build
```

Running `yarn setup` will set up the Grain runtime, standard library, and CLI, and `yarn compiler build` will compile the compiler (it's pretty meta—we know).

After running these commands, you've have a new command available on your command line—`grain`. The `grain` command is a CLI tool that both compiles and runs Grain programs.

You can check that everything is installed properly by running the version command:

```bash
grain --version
```

If you see a a version for the CLI and the compiler, you're all set!

We'll first use the `grain` CLI to compile and run a Hello World program, but first let's set up our editor.
